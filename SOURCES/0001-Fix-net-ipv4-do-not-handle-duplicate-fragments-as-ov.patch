Subject: [PATCH 1/1] Fix "net: ipv4: do not handle duplicate fragments as
 overlapping"

ade446403bfb ("net: ipv4: do not handle duplicate fragments as
overlapping") was backported to many stable trees, but it had a problem
that was "accidentally" fixed by the upstream commit 0ff89efb5246 ("ip:
fail fast on IP defrag errors")

This is the fixup for that problem as we do not want the larger patch in
the older stable trees.

Fixes: ade446403bfb ("net: ipv4: do not handle duplicate fragments as overlapping")
